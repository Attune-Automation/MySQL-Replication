This particular command allows any connections that originate from the 
replica server’s IP addresses.

Changes to the replica’s firewall rules aren't required, since the replica 
server(s) won’t receive any incoming connections and the outgoing connections 
to the source MySQL server aren’t blocked by the Firewall.
